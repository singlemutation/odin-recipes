    <h1>Crab Rangoons</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This crab Rangoon is said to be the closest to the Rangoon served at a certain 
        Asian food chain. This favorite appetizer can also be deep-fried instead of 
        baked.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>cooking spray</li>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese</li>
                <li>1 (6 ounce) can crabmeat, drained and flaked</li>
                <li>2 green onions with tops, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>Â½ teaspoon light soy sauce</li>
                <li>48 wonton wrappers</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly spray a baking sheet 
                    with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Combine cream cheese, crabmeat, green onions, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, 
                    and soy sauce together in a bowl.</li>
                <li>To prevent wonton wrappers from drying, prepare only one or two Rangoon at a 
                    time, keeping the other wrappers under a damp towel. Place 1 teaspoon crab 
                    filling onto the center of each wonton wrapper. Moisten edges with water and 
                    fold wrapper diagonally to form a triangle, pressing edges to seal and pressing 
                    out any air pockets. Moisten one of the bottom corners. Create a crown by 
                    pulling both bottom corners together and sealing. Repeat with remaining 
                    wonton wrappers and crab filling.</li>
                <li>Arrange Rangoon on the baking sheet and lightly spray with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
