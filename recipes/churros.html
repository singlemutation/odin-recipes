    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Churros (Mexican fritters) are very common at fairs. In my border hometown, the 
        line at this stand is always overwhelming. People wait hours in line just to get a 
        taste of these churros. I have run across several recipes but this is the best one 
        by far.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>2 ½ tablespoons white sugar</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>
                <li>½ cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine water, 2 ½ tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a 
                    small saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and remove from 
                    the heat. Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball.</li>
                <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Transfer dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Carefully 
                    pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil; work in batches so you 
                    don't crowd the fryer. Cook until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to 
                    transfer churros to paper towels to drain.</li>
                <li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and 
                    sugar mixture.</li>
            </ol>
