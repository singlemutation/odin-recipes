    <h1>Red Lentil Curry</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This red lentil curry is rich and hearty. It's great as a main meal rather than a side 
        dish like the more traditional Indian dhal. Don't let the ingredient list faze you â€” 
        this is an easy dish to make. This dish is excellent served with basmati rice.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups red lentils</li>
                <li>3 cups water, or more as needed</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons curry paste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger</li>
                <li>1 (14.25 ounce) can tomato puree</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash lentils in cold water until water runs clear.</li>
                <li>Put lentils in a pot with enough water to cover; bring to a boil and reduce heat to 
                    medium-low. Cover and simmer, adding water as needed to keep lentils 
                    covered, until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions in 
                    hot oil until caramelized, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Mix together curry paste, curry powder, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, salt, 
                    sugar, garlic, and ginger in a large bowl; stir into onions. Increase heat to high 
                    and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in tomato puree and lentils; cook until warmed through.</li>
            </ol>
